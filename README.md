# web-rca

This plugin is meant to provide a table of all incidents related to an entity.
If you are viewing a service entity, you can click the `issues` tabs and at the
bottom you'll see a card titled "Web RCA Incidents".  In this card, you will
find a table showing the id, summary, and description of incidents related to
the current entity.  Clicking the ID field will open the incident in the
web-rca ui in a new tab.

Linking this information to inScope, particularly in the `issues` tab allows
services owners to see web-rca incidents next to GitHub issues to make sure all
problems are covered.  This also makes a great analog to web-rca's "follow up"
feature.
